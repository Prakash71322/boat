Working with Namespaces and Pods

Overview of Namespaces and creating Namespaces
Introduction to Pods
Pods Lifecycle
Working with YAML files
Working with Pods to manage multiple containers
Deploying Pods using kubectl run command.
Scheduling Pods

Manual Scheduling
Scheduling Pod using Binding Labels and Selectors
Labels and Selectors in ReplicaSet Resource Requiments and Limits
Create a POD with resource requirement & Limit DeamonSets
Create DaemonSets Static Pods
Multiple Scheduler
Docker commands instead of kubectl commands in static POD Assisted Practice: Multiple Scheduler – Introduction
Configure the POD with custom scheduler Assisted Practice: Create custom scheduler in Kubeadm Task Allocation Using Kubernetes Scheduler
Logging and Monitoring

Monitor Cluster Components
Install and configure Metric Server Managing Application Logs
kubectl top commands
Viewing logs in multicontainer POD Health Monitoring Using Kubernetes
Application Lifecycle Management

Rolling Updates and Rollbacks
Deployment rolling update with kubectl rollout (command)
Assisted Practice: Deployment rolling update by editing the Deployment file
Assisted Practice: Rollout status check
Rollout pause and resume
Rollbacks with command and deployment file
Assisted Practice: Updating the rollback deployment method
Configure Applications
Commands and Arguments
Scale up application with more replicas
Assisted Practice: Scale down application with fewer replicas
Assisted Practice: Scale up and down with kubectl command
Multi-container PODs
Create a multi-container pod that accesses the same volume

Troubleshooting: Application Failures, Control Panel Failures, and Network Failures

Application failure
Application Failure – Check POD, Logs and Events Control Panel Failure
Check controlplane failure status in POD and service Worker Node Failure
Check Node status, describe node to know cause Assisted Practice: Top command to check node performance Assisted Practice: Connectivity with master and cert status Assisted Practice: Worker node failure checks
Networking Failure
Service connectivity check Assisted Practice: Nslookup check
kube-proxy check and CNI plugin check Assisted Practice: Network failure check in above stuffs Debugging
